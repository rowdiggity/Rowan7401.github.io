            tight deadlines and need their tools and equipment quickly, to DIY home improvement people who have less
            industrial
            needs. Besides organizing and stocking the aisles during downtime, I also complete the tedious process of
            re-keying
            locks and cutting keys which requires a good amount of dexterity. Overall, I help ensure that customers can
            get in
            and out of the highest grossing Home Depot of the region promptly, finding their items without difficulty.

            ages U8-U12

            players on basic
            concepts when they struggled to follow rules and encouraged players who were successful and correct in their
            play. When
            over-enthusiastic coaches, parents, or players got out of hand, I used techniques learned in the training
            modules to
            handle situations calmly and appropriately. Most of all, I made sure games were fun! </h4>
